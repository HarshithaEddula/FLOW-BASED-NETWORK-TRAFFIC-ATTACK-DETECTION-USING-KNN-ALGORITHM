# FLOW-BASED-NETWORK-TRAFFIC-ATTACK-DETECTION-USING-KNN-ALGORITHM
This project focuses on flow-based network intrusion detection using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Unlike packet-based analysis, this system works at the flow level, making detection more scalable and efficient. The main objective is to classify network traffic as either normal or malicious.
